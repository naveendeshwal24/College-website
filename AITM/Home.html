					<p>In my opinion, College in good enough if you want to work on yourself without getting disturb with the Academics Curriculum, you will learn ‘n’ number of subject in your course but you have to master one of them.
					College campus is good on the basis of your fee structure. Even you can prepare for different streams or may be the government jobs also.<br>Some of the students are dominating because it belongs to the local Area of Palwal District, but every thing could be fine if you have guts to fight back.

					<p>College is good if you really want to work hard, but the problem which I found most of the time is that you can’t mooch around with the girls too much. It’s just the thinking of the students who belongs to rural area but you will also get some good friends who will always help you to go ahead in your life as mine are and always be ready to fight for you and support you in canteen also. But you have to ignore those who don’t like your opinion.
					But you will not get placements for higher companies from here. You have to work hard.</p>
